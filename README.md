# UNF-Compilers
This contains the projects from University of North Florida's COP4620 course with [Dr. Eggen](https://www.unf.edu/~ree/).

I did these projects in C++, which I would **NOT** recommend. As of Spring 2020, the C++ version on the UNF server is not the most recent, and thus I had to write my own versions of functions in C++11 as they were not supported. Save yourself the hassle.

Projects 2, 4, and 5 build off of Project 1, so make good decisions regarding Project 1. Good decisions like not using C++.
